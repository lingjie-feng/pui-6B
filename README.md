# pui 6B
Assignments 6B for the 05430 PUI course.

**Note:**
I only implemented one product detail page, so for testing the shopping cart functionality, please add different sizes, colors, and/or quantities of that single product to the shopping cart once or multiple times. 


**Regrading request: 6A points back:**
point loss: the number of items added to cart was not correctly displayed
now: fixed the issue;
